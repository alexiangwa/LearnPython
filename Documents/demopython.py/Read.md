 VARIABLES
 
 What is variables: itâ€™s nothing but a reserved memory location to store values in other words a variable in a program gives data to the computer to work on.

How to declare variables and use: no need to declare variables before using them.
A = 10
Print(a)
=10

x=4
Print(x) or print('x') or print("x")
4

y=5.6
Print(type(x))

>>> y=5.6
>>> print(y)
5.6
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'int'>
>>> print(type(y))
<class 'float'>
>>>



Displaying a variable value using print:
Re declare variable
y=5.6
Print(type(x))

>>> y=5.6
>>> print(y)
5.6
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'int'>
>>> print(type(y))
<class 'float'>
>>>
