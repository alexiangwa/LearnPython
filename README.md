# LearnPython
To comments a line use # symbol or ''' <readme>''' this will comment multiple lines its call tribe code ''' <> '''

Special character if we want to print the following line in two separate lines we will have to include 
Always write special char in double quotation
	- \n = new line
	- \b = back space ("hello world") = ("hello\bworld")=("helloworld")
	- \t(tab) = give space 
	- \ = escape symbol = ('python's class') will give a syntax error (because python will consider the first two quotation and will not run the last )but with a \ =('python\'s class') 
	- \a = alert sound
Print ("welcome to python scripting, we are working with special characters") 

Print("welcome to python scripting, \nwe are working with special characters")
